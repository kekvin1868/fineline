A full-stack web application designed to help you track and manage your personal finances in detail.

### Key Features
- Detailed Transaction Logging: Create and save a comprehensive log of every transaction, including date, amount, and a custom description.

- Wallet Separation: Manage your transactions in a personal ledger, completely separated from your actual financial accounts. This provides a secure and private way to track your spending without linking to sensitive information.

- Customizable Categories: Go beyond standard categories. Create, edit, and assign your own custom transaction categories (e.g., Groceries, Leisure, Investments, Food) to perfectly match your spending habits and analytical needs.

- Persistent Data Storage: Every user has their own secure data, which is automatically saved. You can always fetch your ledger right where you left off, ensuring your financial records are consistently maintained.
